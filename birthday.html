I'll tease u and make fun of u but never let tears come out of ur eyes.
I'll always abuse u, shout at u but never let anyone else to do that.
You r annoying,irritating and the dumbest person i ever met but i'll still choose to be with you.
I'll leave u sometimes to fight ur own battles but i'll ensure that no one can ever hurt u in my absence.
I'll give u my shoulders to cry on,no matter how many times u ask me to go away.
I'll make sure no one can hurt u by their words or by their actions.
I may angry at you for little things but still love u from the core of my heart‚ù§üíõ..</p>
